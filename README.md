# Python_Projects
A repo containing all projects in python that I work on during my free time. 

### Hangman.ipynb
Modified version of common hangman game in Python. Includes word list from MIT (https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000). Picks random word from this list based on user's choice of how many letters they wish the word to be. Has more catches to ensure only one letter is chosen by the user. Replay now asks for difficulty change every time user decides to play again. Hangman now depicts the character slowly being drawn. Game now streamlined to run with just calling the main function 'game()'
